Hello World!!! 

I'm Jordin

Software Engineering Student

I have basic knowledge of Python, Java, and C++

I love everything about Artificial Intelligence as long as we don't use it to kill us all XD

I'm very enthusiastic about learning something new every day

My curiosity has helped me to discover different interesting things

I believe we are peaces of code diving in an infinite knowledge database called The Universe.

Thank you for taking your valuable time to read my bio!

May the force stay with you!!!
